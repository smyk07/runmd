# How this To-Do works

- There will be a branch for each feature (`todo1.1`, `todo1.2`, etc.)
- These feature branches will merge into `dev` when the feature implementation is completed
- The `dev` branch is merged into `main` for every major release update.

# To-Dos

- [x] 1.1 Initial Setup with Typer

- [ ] 1.2 Figure out how we can:

  - [ ] run the code snippet in the specified runtime / compiler.
  - [ ] appdend the outputs to a quote directly below the code snippet in the markdown file.

- [ ] 1.3 runmd error handling: return any error to `main.py`

- [ ] 1.4 Hot-reload compiling functionality
